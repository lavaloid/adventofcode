# adventofcode
 My solution to Advent of Code. I forgot to save the other solutions to Day 1 and 2 of 2020, so there's only one of the parts there. I mostly use Python to be quick, but sometimes I made stuff in other languages too like C++.

## Requirements
Some of my solutions might need libraries that are not built-in:
- 2020 Day 7: Needs `networkx`. Install with `pip install networkx`.
