My solution to Advent of Code.

## 2022
I started AOC2022 with the plan to do every day in a different language I haven't coded in before, but quickly decided it was not a good idea. However, I did manage to get Day 1 completed with APL. I liked it enough that I decided to do the entire challenge in APL. To be more specific, I used [Dyalog APL](https://www.dyalog.com/). 

Yay funny squiggles!

## 2020
I forgot to save the other solutions to Day 1 and 2 of 2020, so there's only one of the parts there. I mostly use Python to be quick, but sometimes I made stuff in other languages too like C++.
### Requirements
Some of my solutions might need libraries that are not built-in:
- 2020 Day 7: Needs `networkx`. Install with `pip install networkx`.
